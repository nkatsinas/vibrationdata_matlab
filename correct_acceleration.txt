The goal of this script is to correct an acceleration signal so 
that its integrated velocity and double integrated displacement 
each oscillates about its respective zero baseline. 

The user must use trial-and-error to determine the best 
combination of filtering, trend removal and tapering to 
to achieve this goal.

Nine subplots appear as follows: 

Row 1, Col 1 - processed acceleration prior to integration 
Row 2, Col 1 - integrated velocity 
Row 3, Col 1 - double integrated displacement 

Row 3, Col 2 - double integrated displacement (repeated) 
Row 2, Col 2 - differentiated velocity from double integrated displacement
Row 1, Col 2 - double differentiated acceleration from double integrated displacement

Row 1, Col 3 - double differentiated acceleration (repeated) 
Row 2, Col 3 - integrated velocity from double differentiated acceleration
Row 3, Col 3 - double integrated displacement from double differentiated acceleration

The goal is that the curves in all nine plots oscillate about the
respective zero baseline.
